In addition to enjoying ourselves, we will see that satire involves far more than calling out corruption in high places, or mocking the pretensions of snobs, lovers, bad writers, and those trying to make it big. It is also a provocation to laugh, and sometimes to wince, our way to a better understanding of what life and literature are supposed to be about.",

Extension of the finite element to multiple dimensions are carried for second order scalar and vector valued equations. Applications in heat transfer, fluid and solid mechanics will be discussed. The course then concludes with the C\u00ba approach to plates and beams. Element formulation, data structures, isoparametric interpolations, locking, analysis of error and convergence, constraints as well as variational crimes will all be discussed.",

How do government institutions like schools, police and elections increase or decrease the salience of various ethnic and religious boundaries? This course investigates the relationship between identity, groups and politics in the U.S. and around the world. We will consider theories of group identity development; assess empirical approaches to the study of racial and ethnic groups in politics and look at how politically relevant aspects of identity can be measured for conducting original research (JPs or Senior Theses).",

We pay special attention to comparisons and contrasts -- centers and frontiers of settlement, urban and rural life, indigenous and African populations, religion and transgression, Portuguese and Spanish models of rule -- and to long-term processes and implications of environmental change.",

The emphasis will be on the mechanisms of organic reactions, with examples taken from biology when appropriate to illustrate the principles. For a complete presentation of the subject, the course should be followed by CHM 304B in the spring.",

How can \"debt\" sometimes be an instrument of social solidarity and other times be a source of social discord? In this course we will draw on history, political theory, economics, and anthropology to look at debates about \"debt\" in different places and times as diverse as 4th century Greece, 18th century England, 19th century Egypt, and the 2008 Financial Crisis and its aftermath around the world.",

Classes are split between singing and discussions of notation as it relates to style, composition, performance and culture.

What forces shape their structure, size, and long-run success? The goal of this course is to answer some of these questions by analyzing cities as economic systems using both theoretical and empirical tools. The theory side of the course covers a standard set of urban models describing both the structure of cities and how they interact as part of larger national economies. The empirical side of the course draws on recent academic papers to introduce some of the econometric tools used to study cities.",

Will thermocatalysis or genetic engineering improve biofuel production? Can we make biofuels directly from light or electricity? These are some of the questions we will answer through engaging discussions, primary literature readings, and hands-on experience in making biofuels. In precept we will make bioethanol from corn (beer) or molasses (wine), biodiesel from cooking oil, and oil from algae. Grades are based on participation, an oral presentation, and three short lab reports.",

Students will visit ethnic and refugee communities, write stories on topics as diverse as social media, education, and entrepreneurship, and produce multimedia assignments and a long-form final project.",

During this period Russia emerged as one of the greatest powers in Europe and Asia. In 1917, it collapsed, and the first socialist state grew up on the debris of the former Empire. In this course we'll analyze the causes of Russia's enormous territorial growth and the reasons for its backwardness; explore why the Russian monarchy outlived other European monarchies and escaped the turmoil of the 19th century revolutions; and pay attention to the development of Russian art, culture, and intellectual life.",
